# What We're Working On!

Hey there! Our lab is all about digging into the **big ideas** behind machine intelligence and seeing how we can use them to tackle real-world problems. It's pretty exciting stuff!

Here are the cool things we're focused on right now:

* **The Basics of Machine Learning:** We're exploring the core theory and finding new ways to use ML.

* **Generative AI & LLMs:** We dive deep into foundational models and massive language models—like figuring out how the next generation of AI actually works and what it can do!

* **AI Decisions & Teams:** We look at how AI makes choices, especially when you have one AI or a whole *team* of AIs working together (multi-agent scenarios).

* **Keeping AI Safe:** This is super important! We focus on making sure AI systems are safe, reliable, and trustworthy.

* **Cybersecurity & AI:** We're working on how AI interacts with security, whether it's helping or hindering.

* **AI and Society:** We think about the big picture—how AI impacts people and the world we live in.

* **Talking to AI:** How do humans and AI systems communicate? We're trying to make those interactions smooth and smart.

* **Tiny Brains, Big Jobs:** We look at using machine learning for smaller devices and connected things like phones, smart cities, and IoT stuff (cyber-physical systems).

* **Networked AI:** We figure out how to make machine learning work smoothly across lots of different computers and systems—making it distributed and connected!

* We last updated this on February 15, 2025. Come back soon!
