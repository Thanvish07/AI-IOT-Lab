Our current research interests lie in the intersection of **Cyber-Physical Systems** and **Data Science** and their applications pertaining to smart built environments and energy sustainability. 

Specifically, We focus on developing systems and techniques for:

* Energy monitoring
* Benchmarking
* Prediction
* Anomaly detection
* Fault detection and diagnosis

We do this by leveraging smart meter time series and other opportunistic data sources. WE have recently started investigating how to leverage **Infrared Thermography (IRT)** for city-scale building diagnostics and energy auditing.
