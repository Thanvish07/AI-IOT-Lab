## Our Methodology

We adopt a **data-first approach** to solve problems in the energy domain. Our work involves:

1.  **Sensing:** Deploying IoT sensors and utilizing opportunistic data sources (Smart Meters, BMS).
2.  **Analysis:** Applying statistical modeling, signal processing, and Deep Learning.
3.  **Actuation:** Developing feedback loops for better building management.

### Key Data Sources
* **Smart Meter Time-Series:** High-frequency power consumption data.
* **Building Management Systems (BMS):** Operational data from HVAC components.
* **Thermal Imaging:** Visual data for non-intrusive auditing.
* **IoT Sensors:** Environmental parameters (Temperature, Humidity, CO2).
