# Defining the 5 core themes based strictly on your list
themes_list:
  - image: "/AI-IOT-Lab/assets/images/energy_analytics.png" # Use generic energy/graph image
    title: "Energy Monitoring"
    excerpt: "We develop systems to collect and process high-frequency **smart meter time-series data**. By monitoring consumption patterns at granular levels, we enable real-time visibility into building performance and identify opportunistic data sources for deeper analysis."

  - image: "/AI-IOT-Lab/assets/images/benchmarking.png" # Use the benchmarking image
    title: "Energy Benchmarking"
    excerpt: "Comparing raw energy consumption is often unfair due to varying building sizes and operations. We build **data-driven benchmarking models** that normalize for weather and occupancy, allowing for accurate peer-to-peer comparison and efficiency ranking."

  - image: "/AI-IOT-Lab/assets/images/PA.png" # Use the predictive analysis image
    title: "Energy Prediction"
    excerpt: "Forecasting future energy demand is critical for grid stability. We apply statistical and machine learning techniques to **predict load profiles** based on historical smart meter data, weather forecasts, and calendar variables."

  - image: "/AI-IOT-Lab/assets/images/anomaly.png" # Use the anomaly image
    title: "Anomaly Detection"
    excerpt: "Buildings often waste energy due to unnoticed irregularities. We research unsupervised learning algorithms to automatically scan time-series data and **detect point and contextual anomalies**, flagging unusual consumption spikes in real-time."

  - image: "/AI-IOT-Lab/assets/images/fault.png" # Use the fault detection image
    title: "Fault Detection & Diagnosis (FDD)"
    excerpt: "Going beyond simple anomalies, we focus on identifying specific equipment failures. Our FDD research utilizes system-level data to **diagnose root causes** of inefficiencies in HVAC components like Chillers and Air Handling Units."

Our current research interests lie in the intersection of **Cyber-Physical Systems** and **Data Science**, specifically applied to smart built environments and energy sustainability. 

We primarily leverage **smart meter time series** and other opportunistic data sources to develop systems and techniques for the following key areas:
