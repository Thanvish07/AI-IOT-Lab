## Our Methodology

We adopt a **data-first approach** to solve problems in the energy domain. Our work involves:

1.  **Sensing:** Deploying IoT sensors and utilizing opportunistic data sources (Smart Meters, BMS).
2.  **Analysis:** Applying statistical modeling, signal processing, and Deep Learning.
3.  **Actuation:** Developing feedback loops for better building management.
