# Joining and Collaborating with the Lab

## Undergraduate Research Opportunities

If you are an Undergraduate student at UCL and you are interested in getting involved in our research activities, please get in touch. We are happy to offer internships during the summer and Final Year projects linked to our research activities.

## PhD Students

We are always keen to hear from prospective PhD students who share our passion for understanding, designing, and evaluating machine intelligence. If you are interested in joining our lab, please get in touch with Mirco Musolesi via email. Include a brief overview of your research interests along with your CV and academic transcripts.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

At the moment there are no advertised openings.

However, an alternative way to fund your postdoc is through personal fellowships hosted in our lab.

If you are interested you can check the [Newton International Fellowships](link-to-newton), [EU Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](link-to-marie-curie) or the [Fulbright Scholar Program](link-to-fulbright). If you are interested in themes around national security (e.g. AI and cyber-security), you might want to explore the [Royal Academy of Engineering UK IC Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Programme](link-to-royal-academy).

Please feel free to contact [Mirco Musolesi](link-to-musolesi-contact) to discuss potential hosting and support for the preparation of your proposal.

## Research Visitors

We welcome visitors from researchers at all career stages who are interested in spending time in our lab to collaborate and explore new directions. Visits can range from a few days to several months, depending on mutual availability and interests.

If you would like to visit, please contact [Mirco Musolesi](link-to-musolesi-contact) with a short description of your research background and your interests.

## Collaborations with Industrial and Government Partners

We actively welcome collaborations with industry and government partners on projects aligned with our areas of expertise. If your organization is interested in exploring potential opportunities, please get in touch with [Mirco Musolesi](link-to-musolesi-contact).
