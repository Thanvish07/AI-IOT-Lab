Research Projects
---

We are currently working on several funded research projects spanning **Energy Analytics**, **Cyber-Physical Systems**, and **Smart City Infrastructure**. Our work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning models and real-world deployment.

      <h3 class="feature__item-title">Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD)</h3>
      <p>
        Addressing the scarcity of open datasets in the energy domain, we introduced <strong>LEAD (Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection)</strong>. This project involves analyzing hourly meter readings from thousands of commercial buildings to identify irregular consumption patterns. We are developing robust, unsupervised learning algorithms to benchmark anomaly detection performance across diverse building types.

      <h3 class="feature__item-title">Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD)</h3>
      <p>
        Commercial HVAC systems are complex and prone to operational drifts. We utilize data-driven approaches, including <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>Physics-guided Machine Learning</strong>, to detect and diagnose faults in chillers and Air Handling Units (AHUs). Our predictive maintenance frameworks help reduce energy wastage, prevent equipment failure, and ensure occupant comfort.

      <h3 class="feature__item-title">Infrared Thermography (IRT)</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional energy auditing is often manual and invasive. We leverage <strong>Infrared Thermography (IRT)</strong> for rapid, non-intrusive city-scale diagnostics. By processing thermal images using Computer Vision techniques, we can automatically detect insulation defects, characterize air leakage, and study occupant thermal behaviors without compromising privacy.

      <h3 class="feature__item-title">Building Energy Benchmarking</h3>
      <p>
        Benchmarking is essential for identifying inefficient buildings and setting policy targets. We are creating next-generation benchmarking systems for <strong>Singapore and India</strong> that go beyond simple Energy Utilization Index (EUI) metrics. Our models account for diverse building characteristics, weather patterns, and operational schedules to provide fair and actionable peer comparisons.
